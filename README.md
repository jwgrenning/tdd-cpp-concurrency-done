### C++ Example portable Threading Primitives

This is an example of a threading library.  It was made in 2004 before multi-core machines, so beware, it may not work on a modern machine.

The idea is to have one threading interface, with implememtations in posix and win32.  There is even an old Visual Studio `.dsw` workspace file.

Have fun!
